##### model.py
- A script containing the ocean model, set up for exploring the response of different oceans in response to anthropogenic carbon emissions.
- This script and model was adapted and used to explore different situations and their effects on ocean carbon, including enhanced rock weathering (ERW), and general fundamental processes and cycles that occur in the ocean.
